* Content type should be handled in storage so the original content type is replied.

* Stop crawling: Ongoing crawlings must be registered. config page should list them with a link, which when called cancels the crawling (after the current file is finished.)
(Currently setting the client to read only mode fixes this problem.)

* Add crawling result in a single commit (but do not lock the repository while crawling - makes it hard).
