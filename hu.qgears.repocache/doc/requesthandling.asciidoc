= How a request is handled

First the cache (git) is queried. It can reply:

 * folder listing
 * file direct content
 * file merged content

If all below is true then the remote file is queried:
 * the server is in online state
 * the cache plugin may decide to not refresh the file

 * The remote file content is downloaded
 * Compared to the cached version (the not merged instance in the cache)
 * In case the remote is different from the cached version then the cached version is updated:
    * direct content is updated
    * merged view is also updated
    * changes are written to git in a single commit
 * File to return is re-read from cache

File is returned to user.

== Plugins

Plugin types:

 * http
 * p2
 * maven
 
A single plugin handles the followings:

 * In general generates the contents to be replied for a specific query

 * Listing of the first level contents of the plugin
 * Listing of the folders provided
 * Merging of the target repositories
